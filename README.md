Sunscrapers DRF tutorial updated with recent code and using my own code conventions with production database Postgresql

This is a Django rest framework repository created following the www.sunscrapers.com Django rest framework tutorial.
This tutorial increased my knowledge of using viewsets and routers and shows how very convienient they are.
I have also used my personal knowledge of django to update the code as well as personalize the project with code conventions I have learnt on my own.
I also took the liberty of using Postgresql; a django production-based database. It is my first time using it hence the many bug-fixes concerning it.
